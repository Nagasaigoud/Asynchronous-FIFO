# Asynchronous-FIFO
An Asynchronous FIFO refers to FIFO design where data values are written to a buffer from one
clock domain and the data values are read from the same FIFO buffer from
another clock domain, where the two clock domain are asynchronous to each
other.
Designed 16x8 FIFO
Read clock = 20MHz
Write clock = 200MHz
